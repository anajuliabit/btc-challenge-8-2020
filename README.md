# btc-challenge-8

This repository has my solution for the [challenge 8](https://github.com/maratonadev-br/desafio-8-2020) of the [Marathon Behind the Code](https://maratona.dev/pt).
The goal of this challenge was create a REST API whose catch input (text or audio) of a user complaining about their car and connect to IBM Natural Language Understanding to recommend a better car.
